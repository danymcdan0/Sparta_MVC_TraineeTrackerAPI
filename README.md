# Welcome to Group 1 Web API Trainee Tracker :wave:

## Project Overview:

The Trainee Tracker Web Application is an ASP.NET MVC-based web application designed to streamline and enhance the management of trainee information within a Sparta Global training program. The primary objective of this project is to provide an efficient and user-friendly platform that allows trainees to update their progress on a weekly basis, enables trainers to view trainee trackers, and empowers trainees to create, edit, and delete their own trackers.

This web application serves as a centralised hub where trainees can conveniently log their weekly progress, ensuring that trainers have up-to-date and accurate information about each trainee's progress. It also offers trainees the flexibility to monitor their own development, review their previous entries, and make updates.

To meet the specified requirements, the Trainee Tracker Web Application incorporates a controller and a service layer. These components are instrumental in enabling the functionality of the application, ensuring seamless communication between the user interface and the underlying data.

Moreover, in order to maintain a high level of code quality and facilitate easier testing, mock tests have been implemented to verify the functionality of the controllers. This ensures that the application behaves as expected, providing a robust and reliable user experience.

By leveraging the Trainee Tracker Web Application, both trainees and trainers can efficiently manage trainee information, fostering effective communication, tracking progress, and ultimately enhancing the training program's overall effectiveness.

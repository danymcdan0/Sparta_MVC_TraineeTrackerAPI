# ASP.NET Core MVC QuickStart - Model-First Approach

A high-level step-by-step guide to building a web app using ASP.NET Core MVC and the model-first approach:

1. Set up the ASP.NET Core MVC project:
    - Create a new ASP.NET Core MVC project.
    - Configure the project's dependencies and packages.
2. Create models:
    - Define the necessary models for your application.
    - Add properties and relationships between the models as needed.
3. Create `DbContext`:
    - Set up a `DbContext` class to handle interactions with the database.
    - Configure the database connection and options.
    - Define `DbSet` properties for each model in the `DbContext`.
4. Migrate database:
    - Create database migrations to create the necessary database schema.
    - Apply the migrations to create the database structure.
5. Create controllers:
    - Scaffold controllers to handle the application's actions and routes.
    - Implement CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
    - Use appropriate HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and route attributes.
6. Create views:
    - Design and create the necessary views for the application's functionality.
    - Implement forms and UI elements to allow trainees and trainers to interact with the data.
    - Use Razor syntax to display data from the controllers.
7. Create service layer:
    - Create service classes to encapsulate the business logic.
    - Move the data access and manipulation code from the controllers to the service layer.
    - Inject the service classes into the controllers to utilize their functionality.
8. Implement authentication and authorization:
    - Configure authentication and authorization middleware in the application startup.
    - Define roles and policies to control access to different parts of the application.
    - Use ASP.NET Core Identity or any other authentication mechanism to manage user authentication.
9. Handle validation:
    - Implement validation logic for the data entered by trainees and trainers.
    - Use data annotations or Fluent Validation to validate input.
    - Display error messages to the users when validation fails.
10. Implement logging and error handling:
    - Set up logging providers, such as Serilog or NLog, to capture application logs.
    - Handle and log errors and exceptions gracefully.
    - Display user-friendly error pages or messages when an error occurs.
11. Create mock tests using Moq:
    - Set up unit tests to verify the functionality of your application.
    - Use Moq or any other mocking framework to create mock objects for dependencies.
    - Write test cases to cover various scenarios and ensure the correct behaviour of your application.
